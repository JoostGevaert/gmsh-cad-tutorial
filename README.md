# FreeCAD to Gmsh tutorial for [pygimli.org](https://www.pygimli.org)

This is the repository that was the basis for the [CAD to (FEM) mesh tutorial](https://www.pygimli.org/_examples_auto/1_meshing/plot_cad_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-examples-auto-1-meshing-plot-cad-tutorial-py) of PyGimli. pyGIMLi is an open-source multi-method library for modelling and inversion in geophysics. Geophysics allows us to make images of the subsurface and core of the earth without having to dig or drill holes.
