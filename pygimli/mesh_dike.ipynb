    "In this tutorial you will learn how to create a geometry in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/) and then export and mesh it using [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Gmsh provides a build-in CAD engine for defining a geometry, as shown in tutorial BLABLABLA, but using a parametric CAD program such as FreeCAD is much more intuitive and flexible.\n",

    "This tutorial is based on an ERT modeling and inversion example on a small dike. However, this FreeCAD → Gmsh workflow can easily be translated to other geophysical methods. The geometry and acquisition design come from the IDEA League [master thesis](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A9bf85910-4939-4159-968b-ef558a6ecb7c) of Joost Gevaert. The target in this example is to find the geometry of a sand channel underneath the dike."

    "Two geometries have to be created. One for modeling and one for inversion. When the same meshes are used for modeling and inversion, the geometry of the sand channel is alreadyincluded in the structure of the mesh. Therefore, the mesh itself would act as prior information\n",

    "The geometries are defined in three steps:\n",
    "1. Each region of the geometry designed separately in the Part workbench, or in the Part Design workbench for more complicated geometries. To get familiar with the part design workbench, this [FreeCAD-tutorial](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Basic_Part_Design_Tutorial_017) with some videos is great. \n",
    "2. Merge all regions into one single ”compsolid”, i.e.composite solid. Meaning one object that consists of multiple solids that share the interfaces between the solids.\n",
    "3. Export the geometry in `.brep` or `.step` format.[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"fn1\"> <sup>1</sup></span> `.brep` is preferred, as that is the native format of the OpenCascade CAD engine on which both FreeCAD and Gmsh run. `.step` (also `.stp`) is the standardized CAD exchange format and also works well. Gmsh can also read `.stl` and `.iges` files. `.stl` files only contain surface information and cannot easily be reedited. `.iges` is an old format for which development stopped after 1996 and geometries are not always imported correctly."

    "(1) The outer and inversion regions of this dike example were created in the Part Design workbench, by making a sketch and then extruding it with the Pad option. See the Inversion-Region in the object tree in the figure below, or the `outer_region.FCStd` and `inversion_region.FCStd` FreeCAD files, ATTACHED!!!. The sand channel is a simple cube, created in the Part workbench. Dimensions: L = 8.0 m ; W = 15.0 m ; H = 2.0 m. Position: x = 7.5 m ; y = -1.5 m ; z = -2.3 m.\n",
